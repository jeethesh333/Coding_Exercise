##This structure follows a star schema:

Fact Table: receipts (contains purchase transactions)
Dimension Tables: users, brands, cpg, rewardsReceiptItemList

Here is the relational diagram representing how the data is structured in the data warehouse. The diagram illustrates the relationships between the key tables (users, receipts, rewardsReceiptItemList, brands, and cpg).

This structure follows a star schema where receipts is the central fact table, and the other tables act as dimension tables, optimizing for analytical queries.

Assumptions: 
1.For some tables, as there are more columns I am only writing certain columns to make it easier.
2.since cpg table doesn't have direct relation with other tables. I am creating cpg_id column in brands table as a refrence to cpg table.
